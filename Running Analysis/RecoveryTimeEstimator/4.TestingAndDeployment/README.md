### Code Overview and Deployment Scope

This code implements a recovery time prediction tool using exercise and sleep metrics. It collects raw feature inputs, standardizes them, and uses a pre-trained model for prediction. Here's how the key components can be used by the backend and frontend teams for deployment:

#### For the Backend Team  
- **Model Loading:** The model is loaded using `joblib` for efficient, pre-trained predictions. This can be directly reused for API endpoints.  
- **Feature Standardization:** The `standardize()` function handles input normalization based on training set statistics. This should be included to ensure consistent model performance.  
- **Prediction Logic:** The final prediction and simple interpretation of results (faster, average, slower recovery) can be directly integrated for clear, user-friendly API responses.  

#### For the Frontend Team  
- **User Input Handling:** The script collects and processes nine key features, including duration conversions. This can guide frontend form design and data validation for a smooth user experience.  
- **Error Handling:** The command-line input validation can be adapted for form validation to prevent common user errors.  
- **Data Formatting:** Ensure duration values are converted consistently (e.g., minutes to milliseconds) before sending to the backend for prediction.  

This structure provides a solid foundation for building a responsive, full-stack recovery prediction application.
