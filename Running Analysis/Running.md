# Running Analysis Notebook

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook dedicated to analyzing running performance data: **Running.ipynb**. This notebook aims to explore, analyze, and extract insights from the athlete's running activities. The notebook utilizes the `Fixed_cleaned_activities.csv` dataset, which is available in the project repository.

---

## **Introduction**

The running analysis notebook is part of the athlete performance analysis project, focusing on uncovering patterns and trends in running data. By analyzing metrics like distance, speed, heart rate, and calories burned, this notebook provides insights into the athlete's training regimen and physiological responses. It includes techniques to visualize data, perform statistical analysis, and compare activities like running and cycling.

Key objectives of this notebook:
- To load, clean, and preprocess running data.
- To generate descriptive statistics and visualizations for key metrics.
- To examine relationships between variables and perform predictive modeling.
- To facilitate data-driven decisions for improving training and performance.

## **Purpose of the Notebook**

### **Running Analysis**
This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of running data:
- Data loading from CSV and initial exploration.
- Data cleaning, including handling missing values and filtering relevant columns.
- Generating descriptive statistics for metrics such as distance, duration, calories, and heart rate.
- Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- Comparing running and cycling activities (if applicable in the dataset).
- Applying machine learning techniques like Random Forest for predicting calories burned based on other metrics.

## **Dependencies Required**

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed in your environment:
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib`: For creating static visualizations.
  - `seaborn`: For advanced statistical visualizations.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For regression models and data splitting.

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## **Steps to Run the Analysis**

1. **Access the Project Repository**  
   Navigate to the main project repository on GitHub:  
   [Redback Fit Sports Performance Repository](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-fit-sports-performance)

2. **Download Notebook**  
   - Go to the relevant directory in the repository.  
   - Download the following file:  
     - `Running.ipynb`

3. **Download Dataset**  
   - Download the running dataset from:  
     [Running Data - Fixed_cleaned_activities.csv](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-fit-sports-performance/blob/main/Running_Archive/Fixed_cleaned_activities.csv)

4. **Open Notebook**  
   - Open the downloaded notebook in your preferred environment. The most recommended platform is **Google Colab**, but you can also use **Jupyter Notebook** via **Anaconda**.

5. **Load the Dataset**  
   - You can either:  
     - Download the dataset locally and upload it to Google Colab.  
     - Use the dataset URL directly in the notebook to load the data.

6. **Run the Analysis**  
   - Execute the notebook cell by cell. Each cell contains comments and explanations to guide you through the analysis process.  
   - Review outputs, visualizations, and model evaluations to extract insights.
