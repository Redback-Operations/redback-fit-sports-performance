# Cycling FTP Analysis Notebook

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook dedicated to analyzing cycling fitness data: **cycling_ftp.ipynb**. This notebook aims to explore, analyze, and extract insights from cycling activities, focusing on performance metrics like Functional Threshold Power (FTP). The notebook utilizes the `cycling_data.csv` dataset.

## **Introduction**

The cycling FTP analysis notebook is part of the athlete performance analysis project, focusing on uncovering patterns and trends in cycling data. By analyzing metrics like distance, heart rate, power output, calories burned, and FTP, this notebook provides insights into training intensity, performance progression, and predictive modeling for key fitness indicators.

Key objectives of this notebook:
- To load, clean, and preprocess cycling data.
- To generate descriptive statistics and visualizations for key metrics.
- To categorize training intensity using heart rate and power zones.
- To build predictive models for calories burned and FTP.
- To facilitate data-driven decisions for improving cycling training and performance.

## **Purpose of the Notebook**

### **Cycling FTP Analysis**
This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of cycling data:
- Data loading from CSV and initial exploration.
- Data cleaning, including handling missing values and deriving new features like intensity zones.
- Generating descriptive statistics for metrics such as distance, duration, power, heart rate, calories, and FTP.
- Visualizing distributions, trends, and relationships using histograms, scatter plots, and other charts.
- Categorizing rides into heart rate and power zones for intensity analysis.
- Applying machine learning techniques like Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict calories burned and FTP.
- Summarizing insights on training balance, FTP improvement, and ride recommendations.

## **Dependencies Required**

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed in your environment:
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib`: For creating static visualizations.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For regression models, data splitting, and evaluation metrics.

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## **Steps to Run the Analysis**

1. **Access the Project Repository**  
   Navigate to the main project repository on GitHub:  
   [Redback Fit Sports Performance Repository](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-fit-sports-performance)

2. **Download Notebook**  
   - Go to the relevant directory in the repository.  
   - Download the following file:  
     - `cycling_ftp.ipynb`

3. **Download Dataset**  
   - Download the cycling dataset from the repository or relevant source:  
     `cycling_data.csv`  
     (Note: Ensure the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file path in the code.)

4. **Open Notebook**  
   - Open the downloaded notebook in your preferred environment. The most recommended platform is **Google Colab**, but you can also use **Jupyter Notebook** via **Anaconda**.

5. **Load the Dataset**  
   - You can either:  
     - Download the dataset locally and upload it to Google Colab.  
     - Use a direct file path in the notebook to load the data.

6. **Run the Analysis**  
   - Execute the notebook cell by cell. Each cell contains comments and explanations to guide you through the analysis process.  
   - Review outputs, visualizations, model evaluations, and summarized insights.
