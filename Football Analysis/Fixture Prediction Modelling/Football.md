# Football Analysis Notebook

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook dedicated to analyzing football match data: **football.ipynb**. This notebook aims to explore, analyze, and extract insights from football matches, likely from the English Premier League 2022-23 season. The notebook utilizes the `2022-23data.csv` dataset.

## **Introduction**

The football analysis notebook is part of the sports performance analysis project, focusing on uncovering patterns and trends in football match data. By analyzing metrics such as team rankings, goals, shots, fouls, and match outcomes, this notebook provides insights into team performance and predictive modeling for match results. It includes data exploration, visualization, and machine learning techniques for classification.

Key objectives of this notebook:
- To load, clean, and preprocess football match data.
- To generate descriptive statistics and visualizations for key metrics like goals, shots, and team performance.
- To examine relationships between variables and perform predictive modeling for match outcomes.
- To facilitate data-driven decisions for understanding football dynamics and predictions.

## **Purpose of the Notebook**

### **Football Analysis**
This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of football data:
- Data loading from CSV and initial exploration (e.g., dataset shape, columns, first rows).
- Data cleaning and preprocessing, including label encoding for categorical features.
- Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations for metrics such as full-time goals (FTHG, FTAG), half-time results, shots, and fouls.
- Exploring match outcomes and distributions.
- Applying machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression with K-Fold Cross Validation to predict full-time results (FTR: Home win, Draw, Away win).

## **Dependencies Required**

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed in your environment:
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For model selection, logistic regression, preprocessing, and cross-validation.

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn

## **Steps to Run the Analysis**

1. **Access the Project Repository**  
   Navigate to the main project repository on GitHub:  
   [Redback Fit Sports Performance Repository](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-fit-sports-performance)

2. **Download Notebook**  
   - Go to the relevant directory in the repository.  
   - Download the following file:  
     - `football.ipynb`

3. **Download Dataset**  
   - Download the football dataset from the repository or relevant source:  
     `2022-23data.csv`  
     (Note: Ensure the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file path in the code.)

4. **Open Notebook**  
   - Open the downloaded notebook in your preferred environment. The most recommended platform is **Google Colab**, but you can also use **Jupyter Notebook** via **Anaconda**.

5. **Load the Dataset**  
   - You can either:  
     - Download the dataset locally and upload it to Google Colab.  
     - Use a direct file path in the notebook to load the data.

6. **Run the Analysis**  
   - Execute the notebook cell by cell. Each cell contains comments and explanations to guide you through the analysis process.  
   - Review outputs, visualizations, model accuracy scores, and insights from the cross-validation results.
